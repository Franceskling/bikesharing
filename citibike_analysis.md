# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.
## Analysis
It is clear from both the quantitatve data on Citi Bike in NYC presented here as well as life experiences that Bike Sharing is quickly becoming part of city life. It is hard to visit a major city and not spot those bright green or yellow bikes gliding past you or locked away for the night. Bike Sharing creates a unique community for those looking for an alternative communte to work and everyday errands. Whether people want to lessen their carbon footprint, get a little bit of exercise, or find a convienent and cost effective ride Bike Sharing is appealing for almost everyone. 
While looking at the data from NYC, it is clear that the young and employed (judging from the bike usage by birth rate and peak hours of use) are the most frequent users of Citi Bike. We can also see from the Customers pie chart that Subscription users far exceed Customers (pay per ride) which leads us to believe that NYC residents are using Citi Bike more than tourists. This means that population will play a large role in the success of a Bike Sharing enterprise. While Des Moines is not the Big Apple, the data supports bringing Bike Sharing to the city. It's true that the population of Des Moines is no where near NYC; however, the Census data shows it is growing at just about twice the rate. According to an article from 'Business Record' written in April of 2019, "Greater Des Moines is once again the fastest-growing major Midwest metro area." It has been steadily growing for the past 10 years, and people have noticed. What was once an insurance town, is now one of the "richest, most vibrant, and, yes, hip cities in the country, where the local arts scene, entrepreneurial startups and established corporate employers are all thriving." says Colin Woodward in his Politico article. The nightlife, restuarant, and arts scene combined with a lower cost of living have all been attracting more and more people to this booming city. It's not enough just to have people moving to Des Moines, we know that we need a certain type of person moving here to make our Bike Sharing thrive- young and on the move. According to an article looking at the migration to Des Moines, there is a steady trend of 18-24 year olds moving here. In addition, a surprising increase in 1-17 year olds was found in correlation to 25-39 year olds. This is due to the "cool factor" previously expressed but also shows "kid-friendliness is almost certainly in play as well". The influx of young migrants along with a strong workforce and thriving social scene make a great environment for Bike Sharing.
